Bike-sharing Demand Prediction App
The Bike-sharing Demand Prediction App is a dynamic and interactive Shiny application designed to provide detailed weather forecasts and predict bike-sharing demand across various cities. Leveraging real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and a pre-trained regression model, this app serves as a valuable tool for urban planners, bike-sharing companies, and data enthusiasts.

Key Features:
Interactive Map Visualization:

The app features an interactive map that displays bike-sharing demand levels across selected cities, including Seoul, New York, Paris, London, and Suzhou. The map uses color-coded markers (green, yellow, red) to indicate demand intensity (small, medium, large), providing a clear visual representation of bike-sharing activity.
Temperature Trend Analysis:

Users can explore a detailed line chart showing the temperature forecast for the next five days for any selected city. This chart includes data points and labels, making it easy to understand temperature trends and how they might influence bike-sharing demand.
Bike-sharing Demand Prediction:

The app provides a trend line chart of predicted bike-sharing demand over time for the selected city. Users can interact with the chart by clicking on data points to view specific bike-sharing demand predictions and corresponding datetime values. This interactive feature enhances user engagement and understanding.
Humidity and Demand Correlation:

A scatter plot illustrates the relationship between humidity levels and bike-sharing demand. The plot includes a polynomial regression line (up to the 4th degree) to highlight the correlation, offering valuable insights into how humidity impacts bike-sharing activities.
User-Friendly Interface:

The app features a clean and intuitive interface, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. The sidebar allows easy navigation between different cities and visualization options.
Overall, the Bike-sharing Demand Prediction App is a comprehensive tool that combines weather forecasting and predictive analytics to help users make informed decisions about bike-sharing operations. Whether for planning purposes or academic research, this app provides essential insights into the interplay between weather conditions and bike-sharing demand.
